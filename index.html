<h1 id="hey-">Hey!</h1>
<p>My name is Ari Schott and this winter I&#39;ll be building computers. If you are thinking of buying a PC, I can help!</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="about-me">About Me</h4>
<p>I am 13, and I&#39;m currently in 8th grade in an SUSD comprehensive gifted program. I love music, hardware, and learning new things. I have experience in photography, robotics, programming, game design, video editing, and more. I also have lots of experience choosing parts for computers and I have built multiple desktops (ranging in price from $800 to $2,000+) for friends and family. I can provide a resume and references upon request. You can contact me at <a href="https://forms.gle/gm5qHkXKM7UpXzqv5">my form</a>.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-offer">What I Offer</h4>
<p>I can build a desktop computer for a better price than what you&#39;ll find at many prebuilt manufacturers, while offering the same or better quality.  </p>
<h4 id="why-me-">Why Me?</h4>
<p>If you choose to buy a computer through me, you get more options than if you go through a regular company. You can also get much better pricing. As an example, a <a href="https://www.letsbld.com/h1-mini-pc">prebuilt</a> made by NZXT that costs $2,000 would cost only $1,800 (build fee included) through me. Those two machines would have the same exact components inside, for that much of a price difference. That extra money could be saved, or perhaps put towards a new monitor, a new keyboard and mouse, or upgrades to make the machine better.</p>
<h4 id="other-information">Other Information</h4>
<p>After I spec out the computer, orders are placed, and parts arrive, you can expect for the computer to be built within a week. As long as the parts arrive in a reasonable amount of time, you could easily have a new computer by the time winter holidays roll around.</p>
<h4 id="pricing">Pricing</h4>
<p>The price of the build is the cost of the parts (after tax and shipping as applies) plus the building fee. The building fee changes based on the price of the parts.  </p>
<p>$1,000 --&gt; $1,500  |   $75 Fee<br>$1,500 --&gt; $2,000  |  $100 Fee  </p>
<h4 id="contact-me">Contact Me</h4>
<p>Interested? Feel free to <a href="https://forms.gle/gm5qHkXKM7UpXzqv5">contact me</a>. In the message, be sure to include a budget, as well as what the computer will be used for (e.g. gaming, web browsing, content creation, etc.) After that, we can work together to get the best possible list of parts!  </p>
